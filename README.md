# Project Description
This is a simple implementation of Andrew Trask's neural network.<BR>
The problem of image recognition is quite similar to this problem as instead of searching for a direct one-to-one relationship between the input and output data, the neural network looks for a relationship between a combination of inputs (which could be a non-random combination of pixels).

| INPUT 1 | INPUT 2 | INPUT 3 | OUTPUT |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 1       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 1       | 0      |

In this example it would be a combination of Input 1 & 2.
