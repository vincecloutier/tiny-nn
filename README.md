# Project Description
This is a simple implementation of Andrew Trask's neural network.<BR>
The problem of image recognition is quite similar to this problem as instead of searching for a direct one-to-one relationship between the input and output data, the neural network looks for a relationship between a combination of inputs (which could be a non-random combination of pixels).
